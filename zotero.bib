	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms on graphs, in particular graph neural networks, became a popular framework for solving various tasks on graphs, attracting significant interest in the research community in recent years. As presented, however, these algorithms usually assume that the input graph is fixed and well-defined and do not consider the problem of constructing the graph for a given practical task. This work proposes a methodical way of linking graph properties with the performance of a GNN solving a given task on such graph via a surrogate regression model that is trained to predict the performance of the GNN from the properties of the graph dataset. Furthermore, the GNN model hyper-parameters are optionally added as additional features of the surrogate model and it is shown that this technique can be used to solve the practical problem of hyper-parameter tuning. We experimentally evaluate the importance of graph properties as features of the surrogate model with regards to the node classification task for several common graph datasets and discuss how these results can be used for graph composition tailored to the given task. Finally, our experiments indicate a significant gain in the proposed hyper-parameter tuning method compared to the reference grid-search method.},
